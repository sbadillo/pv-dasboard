# Data Dashboard - Seasonal Solar Production

## Motivation

The PV observer webapp plots estimated solar production for a Photovolotaic (PV) System.

The application relies on the user input of location. The backend makes use of the PVGIS webservice to obtain Solar PV estimated yield.
Finally, the plotly.js library is used to display results to the user.

other tools used in this project:

- heroku
- plotly.js
- flask
- bootstrap.js
